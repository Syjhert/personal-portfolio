# [Personal Portfolio](https://jorashjonathanrobillos.vercel.app/)
This is a simple personal portfolio project featuring a home section and a navbar. 
Additional features will be added soon through branch merging to avoid breaking the
active website with unfinished progress.

- I will be trying to make a React version of this with better features and colors.

# Features
- A clean and responsive home section to welcome and introduce guests to the developer.
- A functional navbar with links to sections (placeholder links for now).

# Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the website.
CSS: For styling, including responsive design.
Git: For version control, branching, merging, and potential collaboration.
